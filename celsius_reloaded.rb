# Welcome to week 2!!!

## In this class we will be learning how to implement gems into our app. Later in
## the day we will be going through the basics of GIT, and we have a special guest
## lined up as a mentor for you!

### For todays challenge you will be required to complete 3 tasks.

### 1. Output the data to terminal using the Terminal-Table gem.
### 2. Build your own progress bar which informs the user how many days are left
###    as they enter the temperatures. Externalise it in a seperate .rb file and
###    require it as a module in this file.
### 3. Clear the terminal screen after each user input.
### 4. Implement the Paint gem in such a way that temperatures over 29 degrees
###    celsius are colored red in the terminal, and temperatures that fall below
###    that number are colored blue.
